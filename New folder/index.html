        The University of Cambodia was established. It was officially opened by
        Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen on 23 June 2003. Originally located
        in three leased buildings just south of the Independence Monument, today
        the University is firmly established on over 3 hectares of land in the
        middle of Phnom Penh
